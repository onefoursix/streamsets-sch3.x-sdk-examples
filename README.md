# streamsets-sdk-examples

This project includes an example of using the [StreamSets SDK for Python](https://docs.streamsets.com/sdk/latest/index.html) for StreamSets Control Hub 3.x

If you are using StreamSets DataOps Platform instead, use the examples [here](https://github.com/onefoursix/streamsets-dataops-sdk-examples) instead.

### [notify-on-missed-execution.py](python/notify-on-missed-execution.py)

This script detects if a Job has missed its scheduled execution, and if so
it sends a notification email.  

The script can be run using cron at the appropriate interval 

Prerequisites:

 - Python 3.6+

 - StreamSets SDK for Python v3.x
 
   See: https://docs.streamsets.com/sdk/latest/installation.html

 - Python v3.x pytz module
 
    <code>$ pip3  install pytz</code>

 - Control Hub login and password for a user with Organization Administrator role

 - An SMTP Server with a user login and password in order to send email notifications

 - Set the following variables in the script:
 ````
    job_id - the ID of the Job to be monitored
    job_expected_frequency_minutes - for example, if a Job is expected to run once a day, use a value of 24 * 60
    sdc_timezone - the timezone for the Data Collector where the Job runs, for example 'US/Pacific'
    smtp_host - the hostname of the SMTP server
    smtp_port - the SMTP port
    email_sender - the email "from" address
    email_recipient - the email "to" address
````

 - To avoid including credentials in the script, export these environment variables
   prior to running the script:
````
    export SCH_USER=<the Control Hub user>
    export SCH_PASSWORD=<the Control Hub password>
    export SMTP_USER=<the smtp user>
    export SMTP_PASSWORD=<the smtp password>
````

Here is example output for a run if the Job did execute at the expected time:

````
    $ python3 ./notify-on-missed-job-execution.py

    Geting status for Job 'Job for Pipeline 1' with Job ID '0d203283-ae50-40f4-b54f-ef8418dc9c79:schbrooks'
    Current job status is 'INACTIVE'
    The last Job run was at: 2023-03-25 10:14:04
    Next Job run expected before: 2023-03-26 10:14:04
    Current time: 2023-03-25 10:33:25
    Expected Job execution was not misssed; no notification was sent.
    Done
````

Here is example output for a run if the Job did not execute at the expected time:
````
    $ python3 ./notify-on-missed-job-execution.py

    Geting status for Job 'Job for Pipeline 1' with Job ID '0d203283-ae50-40f4-b54f-ef8418dc9c79:schbrooks'
    Current job status is 'INACTIVE'
    The last Job run was at: 2023-03-25 10:14:04
    Next Job run expected before: 2023-03-25 10:19:04
    Current time: 2023-03-25 10:55:03

    ===================================================++++=========

Additionally, if the Job is not in an INACTIVE state when the script runs, the following output is written:
````
    $ python3 ./notify-on-missed-job-execution.py

    Geting status for Job 'Job for Pipeline 1' with Job ID '0d203283-ae50-40f4-b54f-ef8418dc9c79:schbrooks'

    Current job status is 'INACTIVE_ERROR'

    Sending email:
    Subject: Unexpected status for StreamSets Job: Job for Pipeline 1
    Message body: Unexpected status for StreamSets Job 'Job for Pipeline 1' with Job ID '0d203283-ae50-40f4-b54f-ef8418dc9c79:schbrooks'
